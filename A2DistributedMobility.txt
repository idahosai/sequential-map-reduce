step 1:Splitting:
documents/available computers= # of documents each computer has to process
step 2:Mapping:
give document to the appropriate computer/process
step 3:
count each word and put key it in a tupple with its # (word,count)
it uses the map fuction to do this
step 4:Intermediate Slitting
-(api)make it so that every node can talk to each other
-make it so that every node know the totol ammount of nodes in the system
-the node ping(api) every other node in the system and waits for response
-
-(if number of responses < total number of nodes, then something is wrong)
communicate with other computers/processes




do we have to implement falt tolerance in our map reduce

When the network heals itself, the distributed system must
 handle consistency issues
